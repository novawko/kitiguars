## General Information

*   Do not claim the Kitiguars as yours! They are originally made by Nova Wolfcreek aka Kayla since 2022.
*   Do not heavily reference or trace someone else's Kitiguar or just a character design in general. You may be inspired by it, but you can't entirely mimic it unless you provide proof of written permission by the original creator.
*   Do not use AI in any shape or form for the Kitiguars or use them for NFTs, you will be blacklisted immediately with a PSA. This also includes scamming and/or stealing.
*   Kayla is not responsible if you are scammed by someone we may not know selling Kitiguars.
*   CBCs also known as Character based Characters are allowed. However, just make sure theyâ€™re different enough to avoid copyright. Kitiguars based on real life people are not allowed, but you may make yourself a Kitiguar "sona". But if you have proof of written permission of a subject in question, you must provide it.
*   Discrimination of any kind is not allowed. This is the unjustified and harmful treatment of people of different categories, especially on the grounds of ethnicity, age, sex or disability is not allowed and will result in an immediate blacklist and PSA. This includes "hate art/speech" or just bullying in general. Respect everyone!
*   Anything that may put (feral) animals and/or minors in compromising (sexual) situations are not allowed here. If something like that is posted here it will result in an instant blacklist, PSA and report.
*   Do not make NSFW for your feral "canon" versions of your Kitiguars! You may have NSFW for only anthro and/or human(oid) AU versions, but the art must be filtered so minors don't see it.

## Adopts and Monetary Values

*   Do not create multiple accounts to participate in raffles, events and anything adopt related.
*   When adopting a Kitiguar, you must abide by the species rules and the person whom you are adopting them from.
*   Every artist has the right to refuse sale or trade.
*   You may sell a Kitiguar or give them away. As long as there is credit back to this website, and to the species and creator of the design.
*   It's strictly not recommended to post Kitiguars with unknown credits to either the design creation or its content.
*   When you buy an adopt, its value stays the same as what you bought them for. Though it can only increase value with art pieces separate from the ones that came with the adoptable.
